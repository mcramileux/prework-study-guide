# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation is to learn something outside my comfort zone. Scary as it seems, as I have zero knowledge in making a website this just gives me a notion that I can do this!

Building this project gives me encouragement that I can do a different abilities that I was not used to as long as I try and follow the instructions properly.  

Every so often, I encountered some problems with the prework. What I have learned is that there should be no hesitation when it comes on asking questions. Whether you search it to Google, watch a video in Youtube or booking a tutor to get a specific questions answered, those are big steps on learning how to code.

Accomplishing this prework opened my mind on how a webpage works! CSS, JavaScript, and HTML work hand in hand to bring into existence a simple website. With this information I have learned, there's more to come as the bootcamp starts in two weeks! It may be an overwhelming experience but I am willing to take it in.
